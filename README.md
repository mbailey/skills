## Security scanning

`scripts/scan_plugin.py` is a deterministic, dependency-free security scanner
for plugin directories. It flags unicode tricks (bidi/zero-width/homoglyphs),
network access, destructive commands, pipe-to-shell, credential-path access,
encoded payloads, privilege escalation, and compiled bytecode.

Run it against a plugin directory (or a `plugins/` parent) with
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```
uv run scripts/scan_plugin.py <plugin-dir>
uv run scripts/scan_plugin.py plugins/            # scan every plugin
uv run scripts/scan_plugin.py <dir> --format=markdown
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` usage error, `2` BLOCK findings, `3` WARN only.

CI runs this as a **non-blocking, informational** job (it never gates merges).
The marketplace currently lists external `url`-source plugins with no bundled
plugin directories, so the job self-skips until skills are vendored under
`plugins/`.

The scanner is vendored from
